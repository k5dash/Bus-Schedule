This is a CyRide bus schedule as described in the rubric. Upon opening you are presented with a table view full of routes and upon selecting one of them you will be directed towards another table view with a bus schedule similar to what you would see on the website or paper schedule. Currently this doesn't have every bus route, only red west and the cardinal route.

There are other tabs along the bottom. The next one pulls up a table view of maps including route maps. The one after that includes the CyRide Twitter page. This is for bus delays, detours, and any of the other things posted on their twitter.

The last tab is a misnomer. It is called settings but includes other things. The first option on the changes where the first tab (Bus Routes) will be colorcoded or plain black and white. The second option so for the cyride alarm. It should notify you when the selected time has arrived. For demoing purposes minutes were turned into seconds. The third (Google Transit) pulls up the google transit site for your convenience. The next option (Post your Position in Facebook) is so you can post where you are and so your friends can know where you and and find you. The last one is "Call Cyride" it has a button that allows you to call the bus. Another item there for convenience.
